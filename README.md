## About Me

I am a fresh graduate majoring in Forest Resources Conservation, at the Faculty of Forestry, Gadjah Mada University with a study period of 4 and a half years. I have a study focus related to wildlife conservation studies, especially on the cat family (Feline).

I am an organized, orderly, and detail-focused person due to my background in Forestry education. On the other hand, I am a person who can work alone or with a group of other people.

Currently, I am focusing on the field of Quality Assurance Tester, which is different from my educational background. Currently, I am focusing on my freelance work in the field of Quality Assurance Tester at Tester Work, followed by taking online Quality Assurance courses
